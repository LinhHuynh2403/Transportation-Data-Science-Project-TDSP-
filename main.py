GOAL: The main goal of this milestone is to set up your environment, install the required packages, learn how to access data and do some basic exploratory data analysis.

Step 1: Setting up libraries and installing packages
- A library is a collection of code that we can use in our program
- A Package is a folder that contains libraries or other packages, organized for easy use

WHAT EACH LIBRARY DOES:
1. Pandas: is used for data manipulation and analysis
  - Series: a one-dimension labeled array holding data of any types, such as int, string, etc
  - DataFrame: a two-dimensional data structure that holds data like a two-dimension array with rows and columns
2. Matplotlib: is a comprehensive library for creating static, histograms, scatter plots, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
3. Seaborn: is built on top of Matplotlib. It provides data visualization that are typically more aesthetic and statically sophisticated
