# Key Python Function will use in this project
1. head(): access quickly to overview of the dataset. This will return the first 5 rows of the dataset.
2. describe(): summarize the statistical characteristic of the dataset. This is useful for gaining insight the distribution, mean, standard deviation, and range of numerical columns.
3. sum(): to calculate the total sum of the column or a series of numbrs, proving essential for quick calculations and aggregations in data analysis.
4. isnull(): to identify missing or null values in the dataset, allowing for effective data cleaning and preprocessing.
5. value_counts(): to count the occurence of each unique value in a column.

# Accessing Data
This project will use the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95">NYC OpenData Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes dataset</a>

# IDE 
I will use google colab to store the dataset and run my code
